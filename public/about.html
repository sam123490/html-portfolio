<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 22 year old human studying web development.<br />
  I enjoy playing guitar, hiking, and reading.<br />
  Here is a poem I wrote.
</p>

<h2>Love</h2>
<p>
Their limbs are interlocked <br />
The roots of a tree are coiled<br />
Their bond grows stronger over time<br />
The thick tree is harder to cut down<br />
Their humor relieves the nearby<br />
The tree shades those close to it<br />
Their longevity blossoms with equilibrium<br />
The tree survives with its deep roots<br />
Their respect for each other falters briefly<br />
The tree flowers after the harsh winter<br />
They reach for their unforgotten dreams<br />
The tree stretches to catch the sky<br />
Their affection stumbles shortly<br />
The tree survives a dry spell<br />
Their strength comes from understanding<br />
The tree never gives up on life<br />
</p>
